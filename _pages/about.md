I'm Chijioke Ugwuanyi, a Machine Learning and Software Engineer currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about advancing AI research and developing robust machine learning systems that can make a real-world impact.

My research and career interests focus on AI for social impact. I'm particularly interested in research and in building systems that address the real-life impacts of the use of AI.
