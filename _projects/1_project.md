## Evaluating Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks

This research project investigates the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks and explores methods to improve their robustness. The study focuses on ResNet-50 models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, examining their performance under various adversarial attack scenarios.

### Key Findings

Our research revealed critical insights about model vulnerability:
- **Baseline Performance**: ResNet-50 models achieve 87% accuracy on clean CIFAR-10 test data
- **Attack Vulnerability**: Under Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks, accuracy drops dramatically to just 9%
- **Robustness Recovery**: Through adversarial training, we successfully recovered 55% of the model's robustness

### Technical Approach

The project implemented several key components:
1. **Adversarial Attack Generation**: Implemented FGSM and other attack methods using PyTorch
2. **Model Training**: Trained ResNet-50 models with both standard and adversarial training approaches
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Developed comprehensive metrics to assess model robustness
4. **Defense Strategies**: Explored various defense mechanisms including adversarial training

### Significance for AI Safety

This work is particularly relevant for deploying AI systems in safety-critical applications where adversarial robustness is essential. The findings contribute to the broader field of AI safety and trustworthy machine learning.

### Technologies Used

- **PyTorch** for deep learning implementation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **CIFAR-10** dataset for evaluation
- **ResNet-50** architecture as the base model
