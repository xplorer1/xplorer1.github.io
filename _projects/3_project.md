## Computer Vision for Autonomous Vehicles

This project focuses on developing advanced computer vision algorithms for autonomous vehicle applications, specifically targeting object detection and tracking systems that are crucial for safe self-driving operations. The work was conducted during my AI internship at Jego Pods, where I collaborated with a team to build robust perception systems.

### Project Overview

The goal was to create a comprehensive computer vision system that could:
- Detect and classify various road objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs)
- Track objects across multiple frames for trajectory prediction
- Handle challenging environmental conditions (low light, weather, occlusions)
- Provide real-time performance for autonomous driving applications

### Technical Implementation

#### Object Detection Pipeline
- **Multi-scale Feature Extraction**: Implemented feature pyramid networks for detecting objects at various scales
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized algorithms to achieve sub-100ms inference times
- **Robust Classification**: Trained models on diverse datasets to handle edge cases

#### Tracking System
- **Multi-object Tracking**: Developed algorithms to maintain object identity across frames
- **Trajectory Prediction**: Implemented Kalman filtering for motion prediction
- **Association Logic**: Built robust data association methods for tracking consistency

#### Road Quality Assessment
- **Surface Analysis**: Created algorithms to classify road conditions (good, fair, poor)
- **Damage Detection**: Implemented specialized models for identifying road damage patterns
- **Real-time Mapping**: Integrated with GPS systems for road quality mapping

### Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch for model development and training
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing and augmentation
- **Data Processing**: NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS for scalable training and deployment
- **Version Control**: Git for collaborative development
