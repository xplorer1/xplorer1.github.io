## Plaid Shell - Linux Shell Implementation from Scratch

This project involved implementing a fully featured Linux shell from the ground up using the C programming language. The goal was to create a functional shell that could handle basic command execution, process management, and shell scripting capabilities, providing hands-on experience with systems programming and operating system internals.

### Project Overview

The Plaid Shell project aimed to replicate core functionality of standard Unix shells like bash, including:
- Command parsing and execution
- Process creation and management
- Built-in shell commands
- Environment variable handling
- Input/output redirection
- Pipeline support for command chaining

### Technical Implementation

#### Command Parsing System
- **Lexical Analysis**: Implemented tokenizer to parse command strings
- **Command Structure**: Created data structures to represent parsed commands
- **Argument Handling**: Proper parsing of command arguments and flags
- **Quoting Support**: Handled single and double quotes in command strings

#### Process Management
- **Fork and Exec**: Implemented process creation using system calls
- **Signal Handling**: Added support for common signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- **Background Processes**: Support for running commands in background
- **Job Control**: Basic job management and process status tracking

#### Built-in Commands
- **cd**: Directory navigation with proper path resolution
- **pwd**: Print working directory functionality
- **echo**: Command output with variable expansion
- **export**: Environment variable management
- **history**: Command history tracking and recall

#### Advanced Features
- **I/O Redirection**: Support for input (<) and output (>) redirection
- **Pipelines**: Command chaining using pipes (|)
- **Environment Variables**: Full environment variable support and expansion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user feedback

### Core System Calls Used

The implementation leveraged several key Linux system calls:
- **fork()**: Process creation
- **execvp()**: Program execution
- **wait()**: Process synchronization
- **pipe()**: Inter-process communication
- **dup2()**: File descriptor manipulation
- **chdir()**: Directory operations

### Code Architecture

#### Modular Design
- **Parser Module**: Handles command string parsing
- **Executor Module**: Manages process execution
- **Built-ins Module**: Implements shell built-in commands
- **Utilities Module**: Common helper functions

#### Data Structures
- **Command Structure**: Represents parsed commands with arguments
- **Process Table**: Tracks running processes and their status
- **Environment Table**: Manages environment variables
- **History Buffer**: Stores command history

### Key Challenges and Solutions

#### Process Management
- **Challenge**: Proper handling of parent-child process relationships
- **Solution**: Implemented robust fork-exec-wait pattern with error handling

#### Memory Management
- **Challenge**: Avoiding memory leaks in dynamic command parsing
- **Solution**: Systematic memory allocation and deallocation with proper cleanup

#### Signal Handling
- **Challenge**: Graceful handling of interrupt signals
- **Solution**: Implemented signal handlers that properly clean up child processes

#### I/O Redirection
- **Challenge**: Complex file descriptor manipulation for redirection
- **Solution**: Used dup2() system calls with proper error checking

### Testing and Validation

#### Test Cases
- **Basic Commands**: ls, cat, grep, find, etc.
- **Built-ins**: cd, pwd, echo, export
- **Redirection**: Input/output redirection with files
- **Pipelines**: Command chaining with multiple processes
- **Error Handling**: Invalid commands and error conditions

#### Performance Metrics
- **Startup Time**: Minimal shell initialization overhead
- **Command Execution**: Fast command parsing and execution
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management
- **Process Creation**: Optimized fork-exec cycle

### Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable insights into:
- **Systems Programming**: Deep understanding of Linux system calls
- **Process Management**: How operating systems handle processes
- **Memory Management**: Proper C programming practices
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and recovery
- **Testing**: Systematic testing of complex system software

### Future Enhancements

The shell could be extended with:
- **Advanced Scripting**: Support for shell scripts and control structures
- **Job Control**: Full job control with fg, bg, and jobs commands
- **Tab Completion**: Command and filename completion
- **Customization**: Configuration files and user preferences
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for additional features

### Significance

This project demonstrates:
- **Low-level Programming**: Strong C programming and systems knowledge
- **OS Understanding**: Deep knowledge of operating system internals
- **Problem Solving**: Ability to tackle complex systems programming challenges
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured, maintainable code with proper documentation

The Plaid Shell implementation showcases fundamental systems programming skills that are essential for understanding how modern computing systems work, making it a valuable addition to any technical portfolio.
