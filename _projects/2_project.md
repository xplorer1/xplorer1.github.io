## MLOps Pipeline - End-to-End Data Engineering

This project focuses on building a comprehensive MLOps pipeline that streamlines the entire machine learning workflow from data ingestion to model deployment. The pipeline addresses the critical need for scalable, reproducible, and maintainable machine learning operations in production environments.

### Pipeline Architecture

The MLOps pipeline consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Automated data collection from multiple sources
   - Real-time streaming capabilities for live data
   - Data validation and quality checks

2. **Data Processing & Transformation**
   - ETL processes for data cleaning and feature engineering
   - Automated data pipeline orchestration
   - Version control for data transformations

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Automated model training workflows
   - Hyperparameter optimization and experimentation tracking
   - Model performance monitoring and evaluation

4. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Model versioning and deployment automation
   - A/B testing capabilities
   - Real-time performance monitoring and alerting

### Key Features

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data processing
- **Reproducibility**: Version-controlled data and model pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
- **Automation**: Reduced manual intervention in ML workflows
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing infrastructure

### Technologies Implemented

- **Data Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for workflow management
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment environments
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics visualization
- **Version Control**: DVC for data and model versioning
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS services for scalable infrastructure
