## Hoppscotch API Live Sync - Part 1: Introduction

This is the first article in my series about implementing API Live Sync in Hoppscotch. In this series, I'll walk through the complete implementation of a live synchronization system that allows real-time updates to API specifications.

### What is API Live Sync?

API Live Sync is a feature that enables real-time synchronization of API specifications between different sources. This is particularly useful for development teams who need to keep their API documentation and testing tools in sync with the actual API implementation.

### Series Overview

1. **Part 1: Introduction** - Overview and architecture
2. **Part 2: Live Source Data Structures and Types** - Core data models
3. **Part 3: Live Sync Service** - Service layer implementation
4. **Part 4: OpenAI Fetcher** - AI-powered API detection
5. **Part 5: File Watching** - Real-time file monitoring
6. **Part 6: Sync Engine** - Core synchronization logic

### Key Benefits

- **Real-time Updates**: API changes are reflected immediately
- **Consistency**: Ensures API documentation stays current
- **Developer Experience**: Reduces manual synchronization overhead
- **Automation**: Streamlines API development workflow
